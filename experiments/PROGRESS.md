|------------|--------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2026-01-03 | Morphology Investigation | N/A          | Bodies have left-upper bias; old fitness rewards any movement       |
| 2026-01-03 | Directional Fitness      | 195.5        | **SUCCESS!** Creature now moves RIGHT toward food (was moving left) |

## Planned Experiments

### Phase 7a: Locomotion Research
- [x] Baseline locomotion training (champion moves 2400px LEFT)
- [x] Morphology investigation (found left-bias in body generation)
- [x] **Directional fitness** - reward movement toward food ✓
- [x] Training run with directional fitness ✓ (moves 196px RIGHT now!)
- [ ] **Food collection integration** - auto-eating on contact
- [ ] **GIF visualization upgrade** - 128x128 → 512x512
- [ ] **Mining behavior** - auto-mine when blocked near food
- [ ] Angular velocity tuning (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0 rad/s)
- [ ] Velocity damping tests (0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95)
