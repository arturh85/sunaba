# Research Experiments Skill

Systematic research for Sunaba creature evolution across all systems.

## Research Areas

| Area        | What Changes                               | How to Test                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Physics     | Gravity, damping, friction, thrust, joints | Training runs, observe behavior   |
| Morphology  | Body generation, part sizes, joint limits  | Training runs, visual inspection  |
| Neural      | Network architecture, sensors, inputs      | Training runs, behavior analysis  |
| Chemistry   | Reactions, materials, world generation     | Manual testing, emergent behavior |
| Integration | How systems work together                  | In-game testing with creatures    |

## Commands

### `/research [<goal>]`
Create new experiments or suggest experiments based on current progress.

**Auto-detect mode:**
- **With `<goal>` argument**: Create experiment from goal description
- **Without arguments**: Suggest 2-5 experiments based on PLAN.md and PROGRESS.md

**What I'll do (create mode - with goal):**
1. Parse the goal (often from PLAN.md or user request)
2. Determine research area and appropriate template
3. Generate descriptive experiment name
4. Create `experiments/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`
5. Add entry to `experiments/PROGRESS.md`

**What I'll do (suggest mode - no arguments):**
1. Read `PLAN.md` for current phase goals
2. Read `experiments/PROGRESS.md` for completed work
3. Analyze what hasn't been tried yet
4. Propose 2-5 experiments with:
   - Goal and hypothesis
   - Research area (physics/morphology/neural/etc.)
   - What we expect to learn
   - Estimated effort
5. Ask which ones to create

**Examples:**
```
/research                                              # Suggest mode
/research "creatures should move >100px consistently"  # Create mode
/research "investigate why creatures don't use their legs"
/research "test higher joint angular velocity"
```

### `/research status`
Show overview of all experiments.

**What I'll do:**
1. Read `experiments/PROGRESS.md`
2. List experiments by status
3. Show iteration chains
4. Highlight current phase goals from PLAN.md

## Templates

Choose based on experiment type:

| Template           | Use When                                                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `code-change.md`   | Modifying game systems (physics, chemistry, morphology, neural) |
| `training-run.md`  | Running training to test changes or establish baseline          |
| `investigation.md` | Understanding a problem before trying fixes                     |
| `iteration.md`     | Building on previous experiment results                         |

## Workflow

### Investigation Flow
1. `/research "understand why X happens"`
2. Read code, run tests, observe behavior
3. Document findings in experiment file
4. Propose fixes as new experiments

### Code Change Flow
1. `/research "try changing X to improve Y"`
2. Make code changes
3. Run training or manual tests
4. Document results
5. Keep or revert changes

### Training Flow
1. Make code changes (or use current state)
2. `/research "establish baseline for X"`
3. Run `just train-quick` or full training
4. Analyze results manually
5. Create iteration with `/research`

## Reference

### Training Commands
```bash
just train-quick              # Fast validation (~1 min), outputs to training_output/
time just train-quick         # With timing

# Custom scenario/parameters (still uses training_output/)
just train scenario="locomotion" generations="100" population="50"
```

### Scenarios
locomotion, simple, foraging, survival, balanced, parcour
