## The Core Question

Can complex, adaptive behaviors emerge from the interaction of simple rules and evolutionary pressure?

This question has driven artificial life research since the field's start. Sunaba approaches it by combining two powerful paradigms:

1. **Pixel-based physics simulation** — where material behaviors emerge from cellular automata rules rather than hand-coded interactions
2. **Neuroevolution** — where creature morphologies and neural controllers co-evolve to survive in this emergent world

## Why Emergence Matters

Traditional game AI relies on explicitly programmed behaviors. A creature "knows" to hunt because a designer wrote hunting code. In contrast, emergent systems produce behaviors that were never explicitly programmed.

Consider fire spreading through a forest. In Sunaba:
- Wood has a property: `flammability`
- Fire has a property: `heat_output`
- A reaction rule exists: "if wood temperature exceeds ignition point, convert to fire"

No one programmed "forest fires." The behavior emerges from simple rules interacting.

The same principle applies to creatures. Their behaviors emerge from:
- Morphology generated by CPPN-NEAT
- Neural controllers evolved through MAP-Elites
- Selection pressure from the simulated environment
